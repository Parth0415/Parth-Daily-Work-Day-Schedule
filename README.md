# Parth-Daily-Work-Day-Schedule

##

My motivation was to build this Daily work day scheduler application responsive and eventful.

I build this Daily workday scheduler application for users to save events for each hour of the day so that they can plan accordingly. Furthermore, i build this application to showcase my skills on my portfolio which will help me to build my career as a developer in a real-life.

The Daily planner schedule will help users to plan and note there events in a scheduler. The scheduler will display the current day and time on top of the page. The scheduler will display the time-block of standard business hours. When the user view the time-block of the day it will display color-coded block which indicates:
Past : Grey color block
Present: Red color block
Future : Green color block
When a user will click the time-block it will generate an event listener where you can add your event. Once you add your event you can press save button which will save the event on the time-block and also in the locat storage which will return it back whenever you press refresh page.

By building this application i learned some new skills which contains:

1) jQuery skills to feature application dynamically.

2) I learned how to use moment day js library in application which shows user current day and time.
